SimpleIO features a number of helpers to simplify hardware interactions. Many
of the functions and classes are inspired by Arduino APIs to make it easier to
move to CircuitPython from Arduino.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.
